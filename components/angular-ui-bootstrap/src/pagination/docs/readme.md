A lightweight pagination directive that is focused on ... providing pagination!

It will take care of visualising a pagination bar. Additionally it will make sure that the state (enabled / disabled) of the Previous / Next and First / Last buttons (if exist) is maintained correctly.

It also provides optional attribute max-size to limit the size of pagination bar.
